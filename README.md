# Skip Booking App

## Overview

This is a React-based skip booking application that allows users to select skip sizes, filter options, and proceed through multiple booking stages such as postcode entry, waste type selection, permit checks, date selection, and payment.

The app uses React Context API for state management of the current booking stage, and Framer Motion for smooth animations in the skip details drawer.

Some UI components use icons from React Icons for enhanced UX.

The appâ€™s multi-stage navigation uses React Context for global state management.
